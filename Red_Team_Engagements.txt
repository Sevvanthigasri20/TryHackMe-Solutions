RED TEAM ENGAGEMENTS

A Red Team engagement is a type of cybersecurity exercise where a group of security experts, known as the Red Team, simulates an attack on an organization’s systems to test its security defenses. The goal is to assess how well the organization’s security measures stand up against real-world attack scenarios and to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by actual attackers.
