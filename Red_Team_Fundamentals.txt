RED TEAM FUNDAMENTALS

In cybersecurity, a Red Team is a group of ethical hackers or security professionals who simulate real-world cyberattacks to test an organization's defenses. Their main goal is to identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks.

1)API

APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) is a cyber attack carried out by sophisticated attackers.
   i)Stay hidden in a system or network for an extended period (days, weeks, or even months).
  ii)Are difficult to detect.Have the main goal of stealing critical data, such as intellectual property, sensitive information, or financial records.

2)TTP
 
TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) are patterns or methods that attackers use to carry out their attacks.
   i)Tactics: The goal of the attacker (e.g., stealing data, gaining unauthorized access).
  ii)Techniques: The methods used to achieve that goal (e.g., phishing emails, exploiting software vulnerabilities).
 iii)Procedures: The specific steps or actions taken to carry out the techniques (e.g., writing a fake email, using a certain hacking tool).
So, TTPs are the patterns or methods hackers use to plan and execute attacks.

3)THREE TEAMS OR CELLS

  i)Red Cell
 ii)Blue Cell
iii)White cell

i)Red Cell
 Role: The attackers.
 Purpose: Their job is to simulate real-world cyberattacks to test the defenses of an       organization.
 Goal: They try to find weaknesses, break into systems, and steal data or disrupt operations, just like real hackers or cybercriminals would do.

ii)Blue Cell
  
Role: The defenders.
Purpose: Their job is to protect the system and respond to the Red Team's attacks.
Goal: They try to detect and block the attacks, and defend the network, systems, and data. They use tools like firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and incident response protocols to defend.

iii)White Cell

 white team is the monitoring the red and blue team .White Team watches and makes sure everything is fair and correct.
